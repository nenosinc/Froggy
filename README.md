# Froggy

Composable, concurrent networking for modern Swift applications. Froggy provides an extremely lightweight layer over the Foundation networking APIs to make it ultra-easy to compose complex requests.

## Features
 - Run and map `URLSession` tasks to your custom objects in a single `run()` call
 - Compose `URLRequest` objects using extended functions like `addPath()` and `addQueryItems()`
 - Easily add authentication and standard headers to your requests
 - Errors are handled and mapped for you, making it easy to understand what went wrong (if anything)
 - Safely set the expected HTTP Method

## Why "Froggy"? üê∏
Naming is hard. Frogs are cool. Somehow the word association from "network" to "web" to "webbed feet" to "frogs" just made sense. Plus, frog populations have been declining worldwide at unprecedented rates, and nearly one-third of the world‚Äôs amphibian species are threatened with extinction.
